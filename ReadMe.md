Instructions:

1. Make a directory on your computer named giggle 
2. Clone git repository into your folder "https://github.com/talymo/giggle.git"
3. npm install - this might take a minute because for some reason gulp-image likes to take it's sweet time. Be patient.
4. gulp - once you run gulp, you will see a bunch of messages in your console. If you don't see any images just yet, hold tight. Image compression takes a minute.
5. Open http://localhost:8181 in your browser and relish in the awesomeness that I have created.
